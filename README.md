# baldi-ps4
The source code to my PS4 port of Baldi's Basics - specifically version 1.3.2.

Check the releases tab as it is a *nightmare* to upload directly to the MASTER branch (at least for me it is).

The reference sheet in the Master branch is kinda what I think works for the Input Manager. Thanks to this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1syswe/ps4_controller_map_for_unity for helping me figure it out (don't mind how old it is). It seems to be different, though, when you actually run it on PS4 - probably because some controls are not allowed to be used in PS4 games (such as the SHARE and PS button) as opposed to PC.
